# Heuristic And Metaheuristic

To fabricate chocolats, Miss Y need Prime-Materies available in a group of N suppliers Each supplier seel a subgroup of PMs with variable prices depending on the supplier.
There are also deslocation costs.
This project should determine a path stating on the factory that helps Miss Y aquiring all the needed PMs with the lower final cost possible - composed by the deslocation and aquisition costs. 

1. Create an instance for this problem, defining N, K, Pki, with k ∈ K e i ∈ N,
Cij , com i, j ∈ {0} ∪ N : i ̸= j. Note: Consider |N| ≥ 7 e |K| ≥ 10.

2. Design a constructive heurístic for this problem. Use it to determine an admissible solution for the instances previously created.

3. Define a neighbourhood for the presented problem. Calculate the local optimal of this neighbourhood, starting from the admissible solution from 2).
   
4. Develop a Metaheuristic for the presented problem and use it to calculate an admissible solution for it.

Final Grade: 16/20
